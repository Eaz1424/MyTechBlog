## My Journey
Wrapping up high school, being free from examinations and looking forward to joining a university may be one of life's most exciting phases. However, the dilemma of choosing the right program, degree and major cannot be understated. Moreover, it's one of the major decisions that in some way significantly shapes your career and the engineering journey that lies ahead. I was in a similar position 4 years ago and hence felt the need to share this. 

I always had this affinity towards electronics/electrical engineering, after I had partly realized post countless hours of consuming nerd content on youtube that much of technology, devices, even computer science concepts evolve from Electrical/electronics engineering; were you to dig deep enough to the lowest level possible you'd find that it is all in some way associated with electrical/electronics engineering. I was thoroughly interested. 

However, I also had this knack for programming, especially after I understood how "coding" is just a way to let the machine know what we want it to do. I loved seeing my ideas translated into a language the machine could understand. It felt almost magical to type a few lines of logic and watch them come alive on the screen. Further, upon looking up the courses offered for this program, I realized that electronics and computer engineering provided the perfect blend of both worlds — the tangible, hardware-driven aspect of electronics and the abstract, problem-solving world of programming. This intersection fascinated me; it was where creativity met logic, and imagination turned into innovation. That’s what ultimately drew me to pursue this great discipline.


## Practical tips for Prospective Students
It is not uncommon to not know what interests you yet. Hence I have compiled a few practical tips listed below that summarize what I did and could help you decide what's best for you. 

* Check out the different communities related to the program, explore related content online and get a glimpse of what it'll be like and see if it interests you
* Visit the website of the institution that you're interested in and read the course scheme
* Pay close attention to the program and course outcomes listed and check if they align with your goals
* Find out about possible future careers related to the program. 
* Lastly, relax, and remember that this decision is just one step in your journey — there's always room to grow and adapt!
