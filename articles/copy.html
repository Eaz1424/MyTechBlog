        <h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>
<p>Wrapping up high school, being free from examinations and looking forward to joining a university may be one of life&#39;s most exciting phases. However, the dilemma of choosing the right program, degree and major cannot be understated. Moreover, it&#39;s one of the major decisions that in some way significantly shapes your career and the engineering journey that lies ahead. I was in a similar position 4 years ago and hence felt the need to share this. </p>
<p>I always had this affinity towards electronics/electrical engineering, after I had partly realized post countless hours of consuming nerd content on youtube that much of technology, devices, even computer science concepts evolve from Electrical/electronics engineering; were you to dig deep enough to the lowest level possible you&#39;d find that it is all in some way associated with electrical/electronics engineering. I was thoroughly interested. </p>
<p>However, I also had this knack for programming, especially after I understood how &quot;coding&quot; is just a way to let the machine know what we want it to do. I loved seeing my ideas translated into a language the machine could understand. It felt almost magical to type a few lines of logic and watch them come alive on the screen. Further, upon looking up the courses offered for this program, I realized that electronics and computer engineering provided the perfect blend of both worlds — the tangible, hardware-driven aspect of electronics and the abstract, problem-solving world of programming. This intersection fascinated me; it was where creativity met logic, and imagination turned into innovation. That’s what ultimately drew me to pursue this great discipline.</p>
<h2 id="practical-tips-for-prospective-students">Practical tips for Prospective Students</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon to not know what interests you yet. Hence I have compiled a few practical tips listed below that summarize what I did and could help you decide what&#39;s best for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the different communities related to the program, explore related content online and get a glimpse of what it&#39;ll be like and see if it interests you</li>
<li>Visit the website of the institution that you&#39;re interested in and read the course scheme</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the program and course outcomes listed and check if they align with your goals</li>
<li>Find out about possible future careers related to the program. </li>
<li>Lastly, relax, and remember that this decision is just one step in your journey — there&#39;s always room to grow and adapt!</li>
</ul>
